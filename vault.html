            <h2>1957</h2>
            <p>On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik I. The world's first artificial satellite was about the size of a beach ball (58 cm.or 22.8 inches in diameter), weighed only 83.6 kg. or 183.9 pounds, and took about 98 minutes to orbit Earth on its elliptical path. That launch ushered in new technological and scientific developments - which led to the modern internet. While the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the space age and the U.S.-U.S.S.R space race. </p>

A DARPA project, <i>ARPANET</i>, was an early computer network that formed the basis of the Internet.

                                <p>When Apple pulled out of the AppleLink program in 1989, the project was renamed and America Online was born. AOL, still in existence today, later on made the Internet popular amongst the average internet users.</p>
                                <p>1989 also brought about the proposal for the World Wide Web, written by Tim Berners-Lee.

                                    It was originally published in the March issue of MacWorld, and then redistributed in May 1990. It was written to persuade CERN that a global hypertext system was in CERN‚Äôs best interest. It was originally called ‚ÄúMesh‚Äù; the term ‚ÄúWorld Wide Web‚Äù was coined while Berners-Lee was writing the code in 1990.</p>

                                <p>The code for the World Wide Web was written by Tim Berners-Lee, based on his proposal from the year before, along with the standards for HTML, HTTP, and URLs.</p>

                                <p>1991 brought some major innovations to the world of the Internet. The first web page was created and, much like the first email explained what email was, its purpose was to explain what the World Wide Web was.</p>
                                <p>Also in the same year, the first search protocol that examined file contents instead of just file names was launched, called Gopher.</p>
                                <p>Also, the MP3 file format was accepted as a standard in 1991. MP3 files, being highly compressed, later become a popular file format to share songs and entire albums via the internet.</p>
                                <p>One of the more interesting developments of this era, though, was the first webcam. It was deployed at a Cambridge University computer lab, and its sole purpose was to monitor a particular coffee maker so that lab users could avoid wasted trips to an empty coffee pot.</p>

                                <p>1995 is often considered the first year the web became commercialized.

                                    While there were commercial enterprises online prior to ‚Äô95, there were a few key developments that happened that year. First, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption was developed by Netscape, making it safer to conduct financial transactions (like credit card payments) online.
                                    
                                    In addition, two major online businesses got their start the same year. The first sale on ‚ÄúEcho Bay‚Äù was made that year.
                                    
                                    Echo Bay later became eBay. Amazon.com also started in 1995, though it didn‚Äôt turn a profit for six years, until 2001.</p>
                                    <p>Other major developments that year included the launch of Geocities (which officially closed down on October 26, 2009). The Vatican also went online for the first time. Java and JavaScript (originally called LiveScript by its creator, Brendan Eich, and deployed as part of the Netscape Navigator browser ‚Äì see comments for explanation) was first introduced to the public in 1995. ActiveX was launched by Microsoft the following year.</p>

                                <p><i>Satoshi Nakamoto</i> publishes Bitcoin: <i>A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, describing the use of peer-to-peer networks to generate a crypto-currency.</i> In Bitcoin, users run software that searches for blocks of data, the discovery of which reward the users with Bitcoins. The transaction is recorded on the system though user information is private. These can then be used online much like cash in the real world. Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoins in January 2009 and a year later a user used them to order two pizzas. Bitcoin's anonymous nature, along with the electronic nature of the currency, has led to its adoption by some criminal organizations. </p>
